= LB2788 - Protecting VMs in Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization with Trilio

Welcome to Protecting VMs in Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization with Trilio

== Introduction

This lab is organised to give you hands-on experience with Backup and Restore using Trilio for Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization.

Trilio is a leader in cloud-native data protection for Kubernetes, KubeVirt and OpenStack environments.
Trilio technology is trusted by cloud infrastructure operators, the largest telco providers, and developers for backup and recovery, migration and application mobility.

Customers in telecom, defense, automotive and financial services leverage Trilio to recover from disasters, migrate workloads and move workloads to new infrastructure.

In this demo, we will explore many common management activities that virtualization administrators often encounter in their day-to-day activities.

== Intended audience

*Virtual machine administrators* -- Those responsible for the day-to-day management of virtual guests in OpenShift Virtualization.
These users will often find themselves responsible for backing up and restoring virtual guests and the applications running within.

*Virtual infrastructure administrators* -- Those responsible for the physical infrastructure hosting the Backup targets.
These users will be responsible for physical hardware, storage, and networking changes to the environment, which will ensure the successful restoration of virtual machine resources.

== Content covered in the lab

These are the *four* main sections that will be covered:

* _Operator Installation_: In this section, we will explore the Trilio operator for OpenShift. It was deployed from the OperatorHub.

* _Creating Targets_: In this section, you will create your own Trilio Targets, used to define storage for your backups.

* _Creating Backup Plans_: In this section, an administrator will learn how to create a backup plan and to launch a backup, or create backups on a schedule.

* _Creating Restores_: In this section, an administrator will learn how to restore a previous backup.
