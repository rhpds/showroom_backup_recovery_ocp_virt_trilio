= Creating a backup

== Introduction

A Trilio backup is a Kubernetes resource that references the actual backup Trilio creates on the target.
The backup is taken as either a full or incremental backup as defined by the user in the Backup CR.

Trilio makes it easy to automatically create your backup plans and all required target and policy CRDs from the console.

== Backup validation

Before creating a backup, we want to ensure that our backup is storing our latest files in the target.
To ensure this is being done, we will create a file on one of the virtual machines to validate the backup.

. On the left menu, click on *Virtualization -> VirtualMachines* and on the *Project* dropdown, ensure the project *{vms_namespace}* is selected.
. Click on *winweb01*
. Click on the *console* tab
. On the VNC console, enter `15` and hit *enter*

+
. Run the below commands to create a file on the virtual machine and verify it has been created.
+
[source, bash,role="execute"]
----
echo 'Hello World!' > backup-file.txt
cat .\backup-file.txt
----

== Create the backup

. On the left menu, click on *Trilio Backups -> Backups* and click the *Create Backup* button
. On the *Backup a namespace* form, enter `{vms_namespace}` in the *Search by name...* field and ensure it is selected. Click *Next*
. For *Target*, select *target-1*.
For more information on how to create a *Backup Schedule* or *Retention Schedule*, refer to this link https://docs.trilio.io/kubernetes/getting-started/red-hat-openshift#about-backup-plans-and-backups[About Backup Plans and Backups^].
. Click *Next*
. For *Backup Name*, enter `backup-1` and then click *Create*

[IMPORTANT]
.Backup error
====
If you receive the following error, wait a few seconds and click on *Create* again.
The *BackupPlan* resource may not yet be available.

. Once the *Backup a namespace* form is submitted, you will be redirected to the *Backups* landing page.
Once the *status* shows as *Available*, your backup is complete.

[TIP]
.Backup progress
====
The backup may take around 10 minutes to complete.
If you would like to monitor the progress of the backup, click *Trilio Backups -> Overview* and monitor the *Activity* section for the progress of *backup-1*.

.*Light Mode*
____

Your desktop might be set to "dark mode."
The Trilio UI does not support dark mode, so you'll need to force your OpenShift console to "light mode."
To force "light mode," do the following:

. On the OpenShift Console, click on the text *dr-admin1* in the top right corner of the screen and click *User Preferences*.
